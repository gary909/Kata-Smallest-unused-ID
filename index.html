        Hey awesome programmer!<br>
        <br>
        You've got much data to manage and of course you use zero-based and <br>
        non-negative ID's to make each data item unique!<br>
        <br>
        Therefore you need a method, which returns the smallest unused ID <br>
        for your next new data item...<br>
        <br>
        Note: The given array of used IDs may be unsorted. For test reasons <br>
        there may be duplicate IDs, but you don't have to find or remove them!<br>
        <br>
        Go on and code some pure awesomeness!<br>
    </p>
